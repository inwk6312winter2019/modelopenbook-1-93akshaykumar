# The task!

Use the attached partial firewall configuration file for the following exercises. (Write functions for each task and call them!)
 
1 - Write a Python function called "list_ifname_ip" to scan the configuration and return a dictionary that contains the "nameif" as the key and "IPaddress,NetMask" tuple as the value.

2 - Create a new configuration file that replaces all (sub-)interface IP addresses that start with '172.' and '192." to "10." and also change the netmask from ("255.255.0.0"/"255.255.255.0") to "255.0.0.0"

3 - Create a individual python-list of "access-list" for "transit_access_in","fw-management_access_in" and "global_access".
